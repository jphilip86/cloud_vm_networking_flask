Cloud Provider: GCP

Video recording:

Zoom/Loom: ZOOM 

Steps : I had run the instance first and got a few screen shots of the sessions.
The video was recorded in the 3rd instance of running the VM so the IP address might be different in the video vs screen shots. Thank you.

The reason for a lot of commits was because I had issues with the screenshots not appearing. After repeated trial and errors it became apparent that the file name had to be separated with % instead of _ at which point it worked.
